1.	Write a program that creates a class called "Student" with the following data members:
name (string)
age (int)
grade (double)
In the main function, create an instance of the Student class and initialize its data members. Then, open a file for writing and write the contents 
of the Student object to the file.

#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>

class Student
{
    public:
        string name;
        int age;
        double grade;
};
int main()
{
    Student student;
    student.name = "John Smith";
    student.age = 20;
    student.grade = 85.5;
    ofstream file("students.txt", ios::out);
    file << student.name << endl;
    file << student.age << endl;
    file << student.grade << endl;
    file.close();
    return 0;
}
