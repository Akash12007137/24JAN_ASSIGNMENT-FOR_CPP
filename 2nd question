2.	Write a program that reads the contents of a file containing Student objects and prints them to the console. The program should open the file, read the Student objects one at a time, and print their name, age, and grade to the console.

#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>

class Student
{
    public:
        string name;
        int age;
        double grade;
};
int main()
{
    ifstream file("students.txt");
    if (!file) {
        std::cerr << "Error opening file" &&8203;`oaicite:{"index":0,"invalid_reason":"Malformed citation << std::endl;\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    // Read the Student objects one at a time\n    while (!file.eof()) {\n        Student student;\n        file >> student.name >> student.age >>"}`&#8203; student.grade;
        if(file.good()){
            std::cout << "Name: " << student.name << std::endl;
            std::cout << "Age: " << student.age << std::endl;
            std::cout << "Grade: " << student.grade << std::endl;
        }
    }
    file.close();

    return 0;
}
