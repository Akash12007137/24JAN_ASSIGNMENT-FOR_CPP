2.	Write a program that reads the contents of a file containing Student objects and prints them to the console. The program should open the file, read the 
Student objects one at a time, and print their name, age, and grade to the console.

#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>

class Student
{
    public:
        std::string name;
        int age;
        double grade;
};

int main()
{
    std::ifstream file("students.dat", std::ios::binary);
    if (!file) {
        std::cerr << "Error opening file" << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }
    while (!file.eof()) {
        Student student;
        file.read((char*) &student, sizeof(student));
        if(file.good()){
            std::cout << "Name: " << student.name << std::endl;
            std::cout << "Age: " << student.age << std::endl;
            std::cout << "Grade: " << student.grade << std::endl;
        }
    }
    file.close();
    return 0;
}
